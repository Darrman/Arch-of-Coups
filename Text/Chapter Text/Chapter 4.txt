A swamp? Time to[N]
go a-swimming![A]
[MidLeft]
Mario, I can't swim.[N]
And I don't have an[AN]
airship. The rest of[N]
us will have to walk.[AN]

Thou must walk around this[N]

[FarRight][LoadDQHero]
At last... thy Arch of Coups[N]
lies in front of us. Before[AN]
we venture past this line...[N]
I thank thee all for thy[AN]
aid provided thus far.[A]
[MidLeft]
So who's trying to mess up[N]
the history books here?[A]

A man known as Kaga. A[N]
conspiracy has arisen[AN]
and he desires to change[N]
the fabric of all beings...[AN]
At this place, the Arch of[N]
Coups, the leaders of the[AN]
planet get overthrown, and[N]
a new regime is instituted.[A]
[Right]
Huh?[A]
[FarRight]
The guardian inside can tell[N]
