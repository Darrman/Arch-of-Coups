This temple has much power[N]
I guard this power......[AN]
Man named [Red]Kaga[Red] wields[N]
power. Power corrupted sole[AN]
He must be dropped......[N]
You have a large army here.[AN]
[FarRight]
So we have to kill this Kaga,[N]
we're in the Arch of Coups,[AN]
and in the process start our[N]

So, you have defeated me.[N]
But that was only a small[AN]
amount of my power. In truth,[N]
I wanted to be overthrown.[AN]
But you must leave quickly.[N]
A large, powerful monster[AN]
will soon engulf this temple.[N]
If it catches you, you may be[AN]
utterly displaced, mangled...[N]
Run, son of Miyamoto...[AN][X]
