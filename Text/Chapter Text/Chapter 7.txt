## Ch7Opening
[ML][LoadMario]
[MR][LoadLise]
Our base is located on[N]
the other side of this[AN]
mountain pass. It is a[N]
wild area, and one that[AN]
has frequent brigand[N]
incursions. We may have[AN]
to deal with them on our[N]
journey. Be on your guard.[A]
[ML]
I'll jump on top of those[N]
brigands, and they will[AN]
not bother us again. How[N]
long of a walk is this?[AN]
[MR]
It shouldn't be too long.[N]
There seems to be bandit[AN]
movement on the mountains:[N]
that's a sign we need to[AN]
move quickly. We must protect[N]
the villagers![AN]
[ML]
Let's a go![X]

## Ch7RecruitingSundown
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML][LoadSundown]
Howdy. They call me... the[N]
Sundown Kid. I can tell you[AN]
this much for certain: we[N]
ain't in the West anymore.[AN]
I'll shoot your enemies down[N]
with this bow, if you'll[AN]
have me. I prefer the gun, but[N]
I'll just have to improvise.[A][X]

## Ch7SigurdArrives
[Left][LoadSigurd]
Hmm... There's a lot of[N]
brigands in the pass...[AN]
Ah, there's Lise and a[N]
man with a moustache.[AN]
I should help them out.[N]
Goodbye, foul bandits![A][X]

## Ch7House1
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML][LoadFace][0x5E][0x01]
I took a look in the village[N]
across the river, and I saw[AN]
some guy wearing a huge hat![N]
He was going on about "ten[AN]
gallons"... I doubt it can[N]
hold that much water, though.[A][X]

## Ch7House2
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01]
There is nothing more annoying[N]
in this world than brigands![AN]
This is why I have moved just[N]
outside town. I won't get killed[AN]
if the brigands destroy it.[N]
Small houses like this? They are[AN]
nowhere near their radar. There's[N]
nothing for them to steal off me![A][X]

## Ch7House3
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML][LoadFace][0x61][0x01]
Hello. Nice weather, isn't it?[N]
If there weren't bandits out,[AN]
I'd go out and relax. You'd[N]
better hurry and deal with them:[AN]
if it was raining, it would be[N]
an utterly infuriating trip...[A][X]

## Ch7Village2
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML][LoadFace][0x58][0x01]
Oh, thank you so much for[N]
saving our village. As[AN]
a reward, please take this[N]
red gem. It's worth around[AN]
two and a half thousand gold.[N]
Please, spend it wisely.[A][X]

## Ch7Ending
[MR][LoadMario]
[FL][LoadLise]
[Left][LoadSigurd]
Very good work. He's clearly a[N]
strong man. What's his name?[AN]
[FL]
His name is Mario.[N]
Mario Mario...[A]
[MR]
That's a right.[A]
[Left]
Mario... Of course! The Italian-[N]
American plumber, defender of[AN]
the Mushroom Kingdom, saviour[N]
of Princess Toadstool? Yes, I[AN]
have heard of you. I have heard[N]
prophecy that you would be the[AN]
leader against some villain or[N]
another. I don't take stock in[AN]
prophecy myself... But that is[N]
not what we are here for.[AN]
[MR]
Has Bowser kidnapped the princess[N]
again? Or did one of his seven[AN]
kids kidnap her instead? It's a[N]
very frequent occurence...[AN]
And what is this "prophecy"?[N]
Has a great evil arisen here?[AN]
[Left]
Of a sort. I am Sigurd of Chalphy.[N]
We've cleaned this pass out of[AN]
bandits. My group's hideout is[N]
close by. Follow me, Mario.[A][X]
