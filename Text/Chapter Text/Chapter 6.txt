## Ch6Opening
[MR][LoadMario]
Huh? Where am I? Bowser? Where'd[N]
you go? Mr. Dragon Warrior?[AN]
My army! Where'd my army go?[N]
The Arch has a-fallen... right?[AN]
Oh no... If Kaga wanted to be[N]
overthrown, then that-a means[AN]
the world's been rearranged! This[N]
is not the Mushroom Kingdom...[AN]
I-a doubt I'm in the Mushroom[N]
World still! Hmm... worth a try...[AN]
Luigi![.....] Yoshi![.....] Princess![.....][N]
...No response... Wherever this is...[AN]
Oh, that soldier looks quite a-nasty![N]
Still got a hammer... Let's-a-go![A][X]

## Ch6House1
[ML][LoadFace][0x59][0x01]
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]
Are you here to do the plumbing?[N]
You look confused. Anyway, (BAD GUY)[AN]
is sitting pretty in his castle on[N]
the other end of the spit. You look[AN]
reasonably strong. You could take it[N]
down, I'd think. Good luck![A][X]

## Ch6House2
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01]
So a bunch of fancy people from[N]
all sorts of exotic domains have[AN]
been around the place for a while.[N]
You look fairly fancy yourself.[AN]
How many people have Ms stitched[N]
into a cap? You'd fit in well with[AN]
that bunch. I don't have anything to[N]
give you except well wishes.[AN][X]

## Ch6Ending
[FFR][LoadLise]
[ML][LoadMario]
Woohoo! I've won this fight![N]
But what do I do now?[AN]
[FFR][MoveMidRight]
Now to- Oh! (BAD GUY) is[N]
already dead. I came here[AN]
in order to defeat him,[N]
but my task has been[N]
accomplished for me. Now,[N]
what is your name, sir?[AN]
[ML]
It's a me, Mario! Mario Mario[N]
of Brooklyn, New York.[AN]
From the day I was born, I[N]
have been the rival of the[AN]
King of the Koopas, Bowser.[N]
His one goal in life is to[AN]
win the hand of Princess[N]
Toadstool of the Mushroom[AN]
Kingdom. He goes about this[N]
by abducting her. And every[AN]
time I must rescue her. I[N]
may not know where I am...[AN]
but this has almost certainly[N]
occured. And now, yourself?[AN]
[MR]
Of course. I am Princess Lise[N]
of Rolante, the Kingdom of Wind.[AN]
My younger brother has been[N]
kidnapped by ninjas from the[AN]
Navarre Thieves' Guild. As a[N]
result, I have been searching[AN]
for Elliot for the past while.[N]
However, a disruptive force[AN]
has left me stranded in this[N]
place, wherever it is.[AN]
I've joined up with a group[N]
of people who are in similar[AN]
situations to this. I feel[N]
that some powerful force is[AN]
manipulating all of this...[N]
Mario, will you join me?[AN]
[ML]
I will! I might figure out[N]
where I have ended up...[AN][X]
