Huh? Where am I? Bowser? Where'd[N]
you go? Mr. Dragon Warrior?[AN]
My army! Where'd my army go?[N]
The Arch has a-fallen... right?[AN]
Oh no... If Kaga wanted to be[N]
overthrown, then that-a means[AN]
the world's been rearranged! This[N]
is not the Mushroom Kingdom...[AN]
I-a doubt I'm in the Mushroom[N]
World still! Hmm... worth a try...[AN]
Luigi![.....] Yoshi![.....] Princess![.....][N]
...No response... Wherever this is...[AN]
Oh, that soldier looks quite a-nasty![N]
Still got a hammer... Let's-a-go![A][X]

[ML]
Are you here to do the plumbing?[N]
You look confused. Anyway, (BAD GUY)[AN]
is sitting pretty in his castle on[N]
the other end of the spit. You look[AN]
reasonably strong. You could take it[N]
down, I'd think. Good luck![A][X]

## Ch6House2
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01]
So a bunch of fancy people from[N]
all sorts of exotic domains have[AN]
been around the place for a while.[N]
You look fairly fancy yourself.[AN]
How many people have Ms stitched[N]
into a cap? You'd fit in well with[AN]
that bunch. I don't have anything to[N]
give you except well wishes.[AN][X]
