[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x64][0x01]
Welcome to the debug room.[N]
In this chapter, things[AN]
are, you know, debugged.[N]
Testing features and all[AN]
that. Anything to make hack[N]
development quicker...[AN]
If you're in here, either[N]
a debug switch was left on[AN]
by mistake, you hacked your[N]
way in with FEBuilder, or[AN]
you're the developer, who's[N]
the only one meant to be here.[AN]
If you're not the developer,[N]
have fun breaking the game;[AN]
I take no responsibility for[N]
any bugs that may arise.[AN][X]
