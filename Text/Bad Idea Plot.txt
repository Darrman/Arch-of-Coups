[MidLeft][LoadBowser]
You've won. But now we[N]
need to work together.[AN]
There's a bigger evil[N]
that must be overthrown.[A][X]

## Ch1Opening
[Right][LoadMario]
[FarRight][LoadBowser]
[MidLeft][LoadDQHero]
Greetings. Are thou thy warriors[N]
I am fighting thy villians with?[A]
[FarRight]
Yeah, we are. So[N]
who am I burning?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Red]The fiend squatting on thy[N]
gate over yonder.[Red] He must[AN]
be defeated in order to[N]
secure this fief.[A]
[FarRight]
So are those other guys your[N]
friends or comrades or what?[A]
[MidLeft]
Ah, yes. Introduce yourselves.[N]
But a quick warning first.[AN]
If thy allies perish, they[N]
will [Red]never come back.[Red]
[Clear][LoadCecil]
My name is Cecil, once the[N]
commander of the Red Wings--[AN]
[FarRight]
Did you leave your evil[N]
armour at home? Next![A]
[MidLeft][Clear][LoadTerra]
My name is Terra... Well,[N]
it's a long story, but--[AN]
[FarRight]
I hate long stories! Make it[N]
snappy, before I fall asleep![AN]
[MidLeft][Clear][LoadMarle]
Hi! I'm Marle! I heard that[N]
Crono was in a village--[AN]
[FarRight]
I don't care about your[N]
chronologies! Let's go![A]
[Right]
Let's a go![A][X]

(He nods his head, indicating[N]
that he will fight for you.)[A][X]

## Ch1Ending
[MidRight][LoadBowser]
[MidLeft][LoadDQHero]
Thou hast done well in defeating[N]
the boss. But there are more[AN]
powerful monsters across the[N]
world. Hither there are--[AN]
[MidRight]
Do you know who the monster[N]
we need to defeat is?[A]
[MidLeft]
I do not know. Thy party[N]
must explore this town[AN]
in order to discover[N]
artefacts and information.[A][X]

## Ch2Opening
[MidRight][LoadMario]
[MidLeft][LoadDQHero]
Pirates! Mamma mia![N]
[MidLeft]
Thou hast a duty to defend[N]
the civilians! We fight![AN]
We must [Red]defeat the head[N]
pirate[Red] to claim victory.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadDQHero]
Thy village is saved.[A]
[MidRight]
So do any of you know how[N]
to sail this ship? I can[AN]
only sail airships. Boats?[N]
I don't have a clue.[A]
#Convenient boat man:
#Figure out who he is later
[FarFarLeft]
I can.[A][X]

## Ch3Opening
[MidRight][LoadBowser]
[MidLeft][LoadDQHero]
Foul beasts, as far as thy[N]
eye can see! What a problem![A]
[MidRight]
Finally, something to burn.[N]
I won't be happy until I've[AN]
[Red]burned every single monster[Red][N]
in this forest![A][X]

## Ch3Opening2
[MidRight][LoadMario]
[FarFarLeft][LoadKazuya]
Do you need somebody to summon[N]
your own monsters to fight?[A]
[MidRight]
Huh?[A]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
I can do that. My name is[N]
Kazuya, and I'm a Devil Buster.[AN]
I also summon demons to fight[N]
with me. You might even be[AN]
capable of [Red]persuading a monster[Red][N]
to fight by your side...[AN]
[MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadRydia]
I'm Rydia... I can summon[N]
monsters as well. This[AN]
forest is dangerous. Please[N]
be careful fighting...[AN][X]

## Ch3Recruit

[MidLeft][LoadButz]
Rattle.[A]
[MidRight]
That isn't a normal sword.[N]
That's a Shadow Killer![AN]
Anathema to monsters...[N]
Yet a skeleton wielding[AN]
one of those blades...[N]
You aren't a skeleton at[AN]
all! Come on! Fight with[N]
us! You'll be great![A]
[MidLeft]
You saw through my bone[N]
disguise. Impressive.[A][X]

## Ch3Ending
[MidLeft][LoadDQHero]
[MidRight][LoadBowser]
Ahh, that was good.[A]
[MidLeft]
Thy temple is located[N]
within the swamp![A][X]

## Ch4Opening
[MidLeft][LoadBowser]
[MidRight][LoadMario]
A swamp? Time to[N]
go a-swimming![A]
[MidLeft]
Mario, I can't swim.[N]
And I don't have an[AN]
airship. The rest of[N]
us will have to walk.[AN]
And this walk is a long,[N]
winding one! ROAR![AN][X]

## Ch4AfterPrep
[MidRight][LoadDQHero]
Thou must walk around this[N]
swamp until thou sets foot[AN]
on the gateway towards thy[N]
Arch of Coups. Good luck...[A][X]

## Ch4Recruit
[MidLeft][LoadPurim]
[MidRight][LoadMario][X]
Hey! What are you doing?[N]
Fight with us instead![A]
[MidLeft]
Hmm... Someone ran off with[N]
my boyfriend. If you can help[AN]
me find him again later, I'll[N]
fight with you now. Deal?[AN]
[MidRight]
Woohoo![A][X]

## Ch4Ending

At last... thy Arch of Coups[N]
lies in front of us. Before[AN]
we venture past this line...[N]
I thank thee all for thy[AN]
aid provided thus far.[A]
[MidLeft]
So who's trying to mess up[N]
the history books here?[A]
[FarRight]
A man known as Kaga. A[N]
conspiracy has arisen[AN]
and he desires to change[N]
the fabric of all beings...[AN]
At this place, the Arch of[N]
Coups, the leaders of the[AN]
planet get overthrown, and[N]
a new regime is instituted.[A]
[Right]
Huh?
[FarRight]
The guardian inside can tell[N]
you more about this.[X]

## Ch5Opening

[MidLeft][LoadRyu]
Welcome to ArchCous[N]
I am named Ryu......[AN]
[FarRight]
Hey! I can't hear you![A]
[MidLeft]
This temple has much power[N]
I guard this power......[AN]
Man named [Red]Kaga[Red] wields[N]
power. Power corrupted sole[AN]
He must be dropped......[N]
You have a large army here.[AN]
[FarRight]
So we have to kill this Kaga,[N]
we're in the Arch of Coups,[AN]
and in the process start our[N]
own coup d'etat. Heheh.[AN][X]

## Ch5AfterPrep
[MidLeft][LoadRyu]

[MidRight][LoadMario]
[MidLeft][LoadKaga]
So, you have defeated me.[N]
But that was only a small[AN]
amount of my power. In truth,[N]
I wanted to be overthrown.[AN]
But you must leave quickly.[N]
A large, powerful monster[AN]
will soon engulf this temple.[N]
If it catches you, you may be[AN]
utterly displaced, mangled...[N]
Run, son of Miyamoto...[AN][X]
