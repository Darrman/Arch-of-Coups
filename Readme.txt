FIRE EMBLEM: THE ARCH OF COUPS
FEE3 2020 VERSION

Apply patch to a clean FE8 ROM.

Instructions to Let's Player:
Load the attached save file. It should be on Chapter 5.
Play through Chapters 5, 6, and 7. These are all fairly short.
Show the dialogue. It's not great, but you may as well.
Show off the character's descriptions as well. I put some vauge effort into some of the jokes.
When the game says END OF FEE3 DEMO, stop the video. A glitch map will appear after that title card, so don't show that.
