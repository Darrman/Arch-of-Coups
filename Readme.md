FIRE EMBLEM: THE ARCH OF COUPS
V1.1

*Long ago, there was a man who sought nothing but chaos in the world.*
*To this end, he created the Arch of Coups.*
*Whenever anybody stepped foot on this bridge,*
*they would be promptly overthrown in a brutal attack.*
*The natural order of all things would be destroyed.*
*In order to preserve this status quo,*
*Mario, an Italian plumber from Brooklyn,*
*and Bowser, his rival,*
*set out together in order to uncover who was behind this plot*
*and foil it once and for all.*

The game currently lasts six chapters, from Chapter 0 to Chapter 5.
The initial release was an April Fools Day hack.
I want to make a somewhat more serious version later.
The current version is somewhat tested unlike the 1st of April 2019 release,
but there may be issues.
I’d say to check the readme if it actually existed.
~~But I’m not smart, so it doesn’t. There’s an unchanged VBA readme instead.~~
I just copied the FEU OP. Better than a completely unrelated hack readme.
I’ll throw a feature list here instead.

* 14 characters
* 11 games represented
* 5 chapters of gameplay
* Skill system presence
* Poor balance
* Artstyle clashes

I'd write a recruitment guide, but
A: this is an outdated version, and
B: recruits are either automatic, inside villages,
or talks that can be checked in the status screen.
I'm just writing this readme for legacy purposes.
Hopefully the 2.0 release, should it ever come, will be of higher quality.
